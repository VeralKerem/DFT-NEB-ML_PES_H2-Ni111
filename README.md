# 🧠 ML-Enhanced DFT Modeling of H₂ on Ni(111)

This project combines first-principles **DFT simulations** and **Machine Learning** to estimate the **Potential Energy Surface (PES)** and dissociation barrier of hydrogen on a Ni(111) surface.

It was developed as part of a research portfolio for PhD applications in **computational surface chemistry**, including programs such as the one at **Leiden University**.
