# DFT-NEB-ML_PES_H2-Ni111
This repository presents a density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) approach for studying Hâ‚‚ adsorption on a Ni(111) surface. It includes potential energy surface (PES) construction, dissociative adsorption energy barrier calculation via NEB, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) modeling of the PES.
